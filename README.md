## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sina, a second-year Economics student at the University of St. Gallen, with a strong foundation in mathematics and passion for data science. Currently, I work as a Student Assistant at HSG's Chair of Mathematics. I have experience in Python, C++, R, and LaTeX. I am passionate about combining quantitative analysis with economic insights and enjoy working on projects that bridge these fields.
